MYTH: BODYWEIGHT EXERCISES DON’T ALLOW YOU TO ADJUST THE DIFFICULTY OF AN EXERCISE There’s a common misperception out there that bodyweight exercise options are limited. Push Ups, Pull Ups, Sit Ups—and not much else.Hmmmm… Did I mention that there’s over 111 different exercises in this book? And that’s not including their variations. The fact is there’s a far wider array of exercises in this book than there are machines in any gym in the world. Other people think it’s impossible to work certain muscle groups with bodyweight exercises. Wrong again. Every single muscle group, and some you didn’t know existed can be worked without weights—from getting rid of a pencil neck to using your shin muscles to round out your calves. The only limiting factor with bodyweight exercises is your creativity. Every weightlifting motion can be mimicked, made harder or easier, with your own bodyweight. And unlike those machines in the gym, there are seemingly infinite ways to vary any of my exercises, keeping your muscles guessing and growing for the rest of your life. For example, I detail Push Ups that even a 600-pound man (or 70 year-old woman, for that matter) could do. And then there’s ones, like the Planche Push Up, most professional bodybuilders won’t be able to execute without lots of practice. My 10-week program actu-10 YOU ARE YOUR OWN GYM

injury.Most, even so-called “low impact” classes or activities like stationary cycling, are not necessarily low-force. And things like running are extremely high-force, damaging to your knees, hips and back. Aerobic dance is even worse.Sure, you’ll hear the occasional genetic exception declare that they’ve never ever been injured doing these exercises. But overuse injuries are cumulative and often build undetected over years until it’s too late, leading to a decrease or loss of mobility as you age, which, in turn, too often leads to a shortened lifespan. Any effect you are seeking from aerobic activity can be achieved more safely and efficiently with high-intensity strength training.Remember, your cardiovascular system supports your muscular system, not the other way around. An elevated heart rate means nothing by itself. Being nervous before a full combat equipment nighttime High Altitude Low Opening (HALO) formation jump always sent my heart rate skyrocketing, but it didn’t make my belt any looser. And even if you insisted on measuring the efficacy of an exercise by an increase in heart rate, I dare you to get it up higher than with my “Stappers. ” So there we have it: Interval strength training is superior to aerobic activity in burning fat, as well as building strength, speed, power, and even cardiovascular endurance. All this in far less time than tedious “cardio” sessions14 YOU ARE YOUR OWN GYM

healthy. Eating the wrong things is what causes unhealthy cravings for excess calories. This is because bad foods can throw our hormones out of whack, feeling unsatisfied and under-nourished On the other hand, the calories in vs. calories out folks believe that weight control is simply a matter of how many calories are eaten in relation to how many calories are burned, regardless of what the food sources are. Using this theory, a person maintaining a calorie deficit of 500 calories per day should loose one pound per week, since one pound of bodyweight is equivalent to 3500 calories (500 calories x 7 days = 3500 calories). Which of these is right? They both are.But, even though it might sound funny, I have to say that the “what you eat people” are more correct. I know this both from science and countless trials. The proof is in the pudding.Yes, you will lose weight by creating a continual calorie deficit, but if those limited calories are coming from mainly overly processed foods with little nutritional value, it will leave you feeling terrible and constantly craving food.Plus, such a diet will reap havoc on your hormones causing you to cannibalize muscle instead of burning fat. This is the diet that most people turn to and it is the reason why weight loss is rarely permanent. As I will discuss shortly, the body’s resting metabolic rate (RMR) is a key player in our ability to stay lean, and it is affected to a large degree by our body composition with muscle being our greatest calorie burning ally. With that said, it’s important to place the emphasis 20 YOU ARE YOUR OWN GYM

the initial gains in muscularity that are common within the first couple of weeks of strength training are largely due to an increase in circulation within the muscles.Similarly, the jumps in strength are mostly due to the body’s neurological adaptation to new movements rather than added muscle mass. The fear that you will accidentally become more muscular than you intended or that you will start growing uncontrollably is unfounded. For women, consistently gaining a half pound of muscle a month is outstanding progress. For men, a pound and a half is comparable. Keep in mind, this will occur under ideal conditions only. A muscular body is built through consistent dedication to strength training and proper nutrition. It won’t happen overnight or accidentally. This brings us to another myth… WO M E N SH O U L D TR A I N DI F F E R E N T L Y TH A N ME N A common misperception is that women will get bulky from strength training. They won’t. Not unless they start popping pills and sticking needles in their buttocks. There is no reason to train differently based purely on your sex. Both sexes gain and lose muscle and fat the same way. It’s true, men and women often have different goals. But surprisingly, these different goals can be achieved with the same programCommon Strength Training Myths 35

YO U NE E D HI G H RE P S F O R DE F I N I T I O N A N D LO W RE P S F OR MA S S Neither your body nor a particular muscle will become more defined by doing a high amount of repetitions of any exercise as opposed to doing low repetitions. How defined a muscle is will be determined by its size and the amount of fat around it, period. For definition we need to do what most effectively builds muscle and burns fat. Doing high reps in order to burn extra calories is extremely ineffective, and the muscle built will be limited, and we should always remember our greatest calorie burning ally: You guessed it— muscle. A consistent variety of high-intensity interval training along with proper nutrition is the way to get defined muscles. If too much size is truly an issue, simply cut back on the calories, because the major factor affecting mass is nutrition. Most adult males could do workouts in the low 2-5 rep range on a 1500 calorie diet for the rest of their days without ever gaining any size. It’s true that low rep workouts, consisting of powerful and explosive movements, will build more size (but not less definition) than high rep workouts, because the “fast twitch” muscle fibers required in explosive movements are much larger than “slow twitch” fibers required for more enduring tasks. But really, for mass, wouldn’t you want to recruit all possible muscle fibers and not just the fast twitch? Likewise, for “definition”—that is, losing body fat so the striations in your muscles show more—wouldn’t you want to recruit all possible muscle fibers, especially since the number one factor affecting our resting metabolic rate, and thus fat loss, is muscle mass? The only thing you should alter depending on your goal—whether it’s to tone or bulk up—is nutritionCommon Strength Training Myths 37

While prolonged moderate pace exercise such as aerobics will help slightly increase your caloric expenditure, it will do little to build muscle. Without strength training, you are neglecting the best fat burning tool in your arsenal: More muscle! I’m sure you’re getting the idea by now… Nothing raises the body’s resting metabolic rate more effectively than muscle. A few extra pounds of lean muscle will burn approximately the same amount of calories throughout the day that the average aerobics class will. Added muscle makes you burn more calories even while you sleep. To gain weight, increase your calorie intake and build muscle through strength training. To get lean, decrease your calorie intake and increase your resting metabolic rate by building muscle.

For those more advanced athletes, it’s tough, but not impossible. With a perfect balance of complex carbs, good fats, and enough protein, your body can achieve these seemingly separate goals. RE S T R I C T I V E DI E T S People often starve themselves in order to loose weight. That’s a no-go! The body is very resourceful, and it will slow down its metabolic rate in order to compensate for the lack of calories. It tries to hold onto every calorie you consume, since it is unsure when it will be fed again.Then, once you resume your normal caloric intake, your metabolic rate remains slowed down. This is why people who try restrictive diets usually gain their original weight back and often some more too. The good news is that if you want to lose weight, you should never be hungry. A well balanced diet consisting of small frequent meals (every 2.5 - 3.5 hours) is the key to long term success38 YOU ARE YOUR OWN GYM

… Keep increasing your reps until going any higher would cause you to hit muscle failure on subsequent sets. Once you’ve reached that point, come back down without repeating the highest number. The rest intervals are the time it just took you to perform your reps. So you’ll have more rest as the numbers get higher, and less rest as the numbers get lower on the way back down to one. Try doing them for ten minutes with a single exercise. If you’ve reached the bottom of your Ladder (1 rep) and the set time hasn’t expired, simply start another ladder. It’s a great, high-volume, low-intensity method to build movement proficiency of any exercise. Train yourself to perform the exercises correctly. If you reach muscle failure at any point during your ladder workout, you went too high before coming back down. It’s okay to perform a ladder workout in the low rep range—possibly even using repeated single reps towards the end of the workout, in order to avoid hitting failure. Exercises where you alternate sides are done by performing the designated number of reps on both sides before resting. P u s h-P u l l L a d d e r: Perform a pushing movement immediately following a pulling movement using the Ladder format, without rest between sets. Using Pull Ups and Push Ups is a favorite in the Combat Control community. S t a p p e r s: Choose any number of exercises and repetitions, and repeat as many cycles as possible in 20 minutes. Usually three or four different exercises is best. Be sure to keep your reps low enough not to hit failure during the first couple of rounds of sets. It’s okay to take short breaks because of muscle failure, but try to keep rest to a minimum. This one can be a real butt kicker. S u p e r s e t s: Perform one exercise immediately after another. This is best done with different exercises that emphasize the same muscle group. For example, doing a set of Let Me 50 YOU ARE YOUR OWN GYM

Please remember that each exercise is not simply about pushing or pulling yourself up as hard and fast as possible. Slow, controlled, negative movements are just as important in developing muscle.

endurance, strength, and power—are emphasized for set periods of time called “blocks. ” Typically, muscular endurance is trained during the high-volume/low-intensity (HVLI) block, which is where my program uses “ladders” instead of rigid numbers of sets and reps. Strength is trained during a medium-volume/mediumintensity block with sets in the 6 - 12 rep range.Finally, power is trained during the lowvolume/high-intensity (LVHI) block with sets in the 1 - 5 rep range. The blocks progress from HVLI to LVHI by decreasing the number of reps and/or sets (volume) while increasing the amount of resistance or the difficulty of movements (intensity)
