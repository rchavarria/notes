## Notas tomadas

### Capítulo 1: la indignante promesa

Un control que te ponga en paz con la comida para el resto de tu vida.

Lo que tú has estado llamando un problema de peso (o dificultad para
mantener tus mejores hábitos de comidas) en realidad es un instinto
de supervivencia que no funciona del todo bien.

Este libro va de afianzar tu habilidad para adherirte al Plan de Comida
que tú elijas.

¿Cómo manejamos los errores al seguir nuestro plan? Nos tratamos a
nosotros mismos como trataríamos a un niño que trata de verdad de
alcanzar un objetivo muy importante. Es la mentalidad de la gente que
consigue dejar de atracarse. La mentalidad de un niño al que le
ocultamos la dficultad para que no sea un obstáculo y sea capaz de
intentarlo con todas sus fuerzas.

Es casi imposible pegarse un atracón si nos negamos a gritarnos a
nosotros mismos.

El acto de recuperarse de un atracón, de una gran comilona, o simplemente
de aprender a seguir una dieta **NO** es como cuidar y alimentar un
animal herido hasta que se cura. Es más como capturar y encarcelar a
un mega perro agresivo. El perro debe respetarte y obedecerte. O encontrará
la forma de escapar cada vez que lo atrapes.

Interrumpir y adueñarte de los pensamientos que sustentan las ganas de
pegarte un atracón no son un juego de broma, es un juego de control y
dominación inquebrantable.

**¿Qué es el Cerdo?** Es lo que el autor llama, su *yo, gordo*. Es la
parte del cerebro que desea que comas con ansia. El Cerdo vive solamente
para atracarse. No se preocupa de las consecuencias para tu salud,
cuerpo, bienestar o felicidad.

Tú eres el único que puede alimentarle. Si entiendes esto ya has recorrido
medio camino para controlar tu peso para siempre.

El otro medio es aprender a ignorar de verdad los Gritos del Cerdo. Cuando
eso pasa, el Cerdo o tú va a sufrir, y NO vas a ser tú.

Nos vamos a separar del Cerdo voluntaria y agresivamente en nuestro espacio
mental. El Cerdo NO eres tú, y NO merece ningún tipo de respeto.

¿Por qué tenemos que ser disciplinados en lugar de amar a nuestro
demonio interior sobre la comida? Nuestros cerebros han evolucionado
en tres partes: 

1. Cerebro de lagarto: los instintos
2. Cerebro de mamífero: las emociones, lo social, lo que nos ata
a los demás
3. Cerebro lógico: amor, identidad personal, espiritualismo, música,
arte,... 

El #2 puede anular el #1, y el #3 puede anular el #2 y el #1

¿Cómo escuchar los Gritos del Cerdo? Para dominar de verdad al
Cerdo debemos distinguir sus Gritos de nuestra sensación de
hambre racional: simplemente... debes crear tu Plan de Comida

Para ello, crea 4 listas:

1. Nunca
2. Siempre
3. Sin restricciones
4. Condicionales

**Cómo no volver a hacer algo nunca más**

El *Siempre* y el *Nunca* son votos sagrados. Deben ser algo
que el Cerdo no pueda asaltar. Los motivos detrás de un Grito
del Cerdo sugiriendo una excepción con ellos deben ser
reconocidos inmediatemente.

Un ejemplo:

> Siempre beber 2 litros de agua

No discutas con el Cerdo. No trates de ganar de forma racional.
Para prevalecer, solamente debes tomarte esas excepciones como
Gritos del Cerdo. Solamente debes ignorarlas, porque para cada
regla que te pongas, el Cerdo tendrá una queja.

Para las reglas *Condicionales*, deben de ser simples. Es
difícil recordar reglas complejas cuando uno está hambriento. Mejor
cuanto más simples.

### Capítulo 2: cómo gestionar el ansia

<!-- you left translation here -->

You do not have cravings – your pig does! So when you feel one coming on, just say: “I WILL NEVER EAT PIG SLOP AGAIN!”

every craving is nothing more than a desire for Pig Slop



You can keep the discomfort associated with cravings to a minimum by staying relatively warm and hydrated, and consuming regular, consistent, healthy meals.

When a substance abuser indulges, they’re making a choice to act against societal pressures and norms.

Food abusers are actually supported by our culture to continue eating poorly.

Your Pig has Cravings… you don’t. And you will NEVER eat Pig Slop again.

Kill Cravings, don’t get high with food. End of story.



Chapter 3: What if You DO Binge?

Bingeing is ALL the Pig ever wants, and there’s NEVER a reason to listen to it before, during, or after a mistake.

What if you DO Binge? What then??? Simple: Analyze what happened, adjust your sails, and then NEVER Binge again.

aajusta tu plan de comida

the first thing to do after a Binge is to examine what happened. Review your Food Plan with an eye towards determining whether you believe each Food Rule within it is still in your best interest.

More often than not, Binges occur simply because you failed to hear the Pig’s Squeal, NOT because of a problem with the Food Plan itself.

This is called a “Simple Pig Attack” and requires NO changes to your Plan.

Chapter 4: Is Just One Bite Off Your Food Plan REALLY a Binge?

One bite off of your carefully defined Food Plan IS a Binge… But the moment you realize you’ve done it you just stop and get right back on track. “We’re off the Plan so let’s have a Binging Party” is pure Pig Squeal to be ignored…

Chapter 5: Changing Your Food Plan



But because the Pig will always do everything in its power to convince us Bingeing is perfectly rational, we must apply a simple procedure to ensure the changes are not Pig driven.

You must take particular care to make intellectually sound food choices after a Binge.

Chapter 6: The Time Counting Trap

Just like there’s no reason to publicly declare how long it’s been since you last ran a red light, there’s NO reason to publicly declare the number of days since you last Binged.

Making a mistake doesn’t invalidate the law. Your Food Plan remains law at every possible moment in

Making a mistake doesn’t invalidate the law. Your Food Plan remains law at every possible moment in time, no matter what no matter what no matter what.

THE ONLY CAUSES OF BINGE ANXIETY





Pig Squeal misidentified as your own thoughts.

Grey areas your Pig has snuck into your Food Plan.

Chapter 7: Overcoming the Deprivation Trap

TWO types of deprivation: (1) What you deprive yourself of by NOT having something and; (2) what you deprive yourself of by having it.

Chapter 8: Defeating the Food Industry

THE SIMPLEST WAY TO THINK ABOUT HEALTHY FOOD

Whole, unprocessed, organic foods are the only genuinely healthy nourishment for humans.

Everything else is a man-made refinement for taste, convenience, or enjoyment. Everything.

One last thing on this point which your Pig will hate: There’s overwhelming evidence which suggests raw, organic, leafy greens are to nutrition what oxygen is to your lungs.

echa un vistazo



None of us seem to know who we are until we see it reflected in someone else’s eyes.

Your Food Plan is a very private and personal matter. You don’t need to debate, justify, and/or explain it to another soul in the universe.

By extension, other people’s Food Plans are also none of your business. Telling someone else they’re eating Pig Slop is a great way to ruin a good relationship…

People have food trouble with others in their social environment because they unknowingly allow their Pigs to go around seeking approval.

teaching other people to see their own Pigs: Before deciding to call a Pig into existence, people are in an undifferentiated state. They haven’t yet separated from their own fat thinking thoughts. Before understanding the Never Binge Again concept, those thoughts are still an integral part of who they are and what they value as a human being. Therefore, the idea of separating from this bothersome part of themselves is at first experienced as a very harsh criticism of their own personhood

Chapter 10: The Pig is Powerless, Not You



People say—and our culture willingly accepts—there are diseases which make some of us powerless over alcohol, drugs, gambling, infidelity, sexual perversions, and pretty much anything else that feels good8.

relapse is an inevitable part of recovery” Poppycock.

la recaida es inseparable de la recuperacion? ni de coña!

Human beings are perfectly capable of abstaining from toxic pleasure. Pigs are powerless over people, NOT the other way around.

the Pig CAN’T feed itself,

porheso intenta comerte la cabeza

Chapter 11: Hard to Recognize Pig Squeals!



The Pig will always do its best to turn “just one bite” into a week-long Food Orgy.

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #2 “90% compliance is good enough.

Giving the Pig 10% leeway only creates the opportunity for it to take more, and more, and more.

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #3 “The sheer number of times you’ve previously Binged despite your most sacred promises and commitments—even

Even if you’ve repeatedly fallen down for years, continuing to get up until you succeed is a mark of strength, not weakness!

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #4 (The "Controlled Bingeing" Strategy) The Pig says: “A planned and controlled Binge once in a while isn't so bad.

There’s absolutely NO need for “Cheat Days” and/or “Controlled Binges” on a well-considered Food Plan which nobody forced you to adopt in the first place.

If you’re unhappy with it, go back and change it according to the procedure we’ve already discussed.

If you’re unhappy with it, go back and change it according to the procedure we’ve already discussed.

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #5 ("I Don’t Really Exist") "You know there’s not really a Pig inside you.

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #6 (The "We Can Only Be Grateful Squeal")

there’s ONE super-duper-wonderful thing we can always be grateful for…Pig Slop!

It’s all well and good to be grateful and shun negativity, but the Pig would have you focus on this exclusively. If it succeeds, it will remove your motivation to pursue longer terms goals with

It’s all well and good to be grateful and shun negativity, but the Pig would have you focus on this exclusively. If it succeeds, it will remove your motivation to pursue longer terms goals with the diligence and discipline it takes to achieve them.

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #7 "You just Binged. Shame on you!

A well person feels guilt and shame when they let themselves or others down. They see it as a signal to examine their behavior and find significant ways to improve. But thereafter holding onto guilt is a Pig’s game.

In your world there’s NO price worth paying for a Binge.

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #8 ("You Can Exercise Off the Calories")

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #9 "You really must eat something off your plan every once in a while or you’ll starve!”

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #10

I’m just as likely to be right as you are.

YOU use intelligence to accomplish worthy goals and aspirations. The Pig uses it for destructive purposes only.

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #11

you’re finally thin and healthy enough to get away with a GREAT BIG GIANT HAIRY BINGE!!!

HARD TO RECOGNIZE SQUEAL #12 "Hold on just a minute now, Bubba! This is about willpower, and everyone knows you can’t diet on willpower alone.

HARD TO HEAR PIG SQUEAL #13 “Just This One Last Time”

HARD TO HEAR PIG SQUEAL #14 “You Will Be Tortured with Cravings Forever!”





the brain will neurologically re-wire itself to crave the healthier thing instead.

if you substitute something healthier to feed your body’s genuine nutritional needs—the brain will neurologically re-wire itself to crave the healthier thing instead.

HARD TO HEAR PIG SQUEAL #15 “I Can’t Get You Now But I Will Definitely Get You Later!”

your Pig does NOT have a time machine, and the ONLY time you can ever Binge is right now.

HARD TO HEAR PIG SQUEAL #16 “It’s Always Been This Way So It Must Always BE This Way in the Future”



Chapter 12: Discipline vs. Regret

Chapter 13: The Psychology of Bingeing, Not Bingeing, and Thinking Too Much About Food

disciplined Food Plan doesn’t restrict your freedom, it enhances it 100 fold. In actuality it is the Pig which seeks to restrict your freedom.

Chapter 13: The Psychology of Bingeing, Not Bingeing, and Thinking Too Much About Food

You do NOT need to know why you Binge. You just need to stop.

The notion that emotional upset causes Binges is actually harmful, because it gives the Pig license to keep Bingeing until the upset is over and/or fully understood.

Chapter 14 – A Radical View on Guilt and Shame

once you’ve made a 100% firm plan to never Binge again, there’s absolutely NO purpose to holding onto your guilt or shame.

Holding onto guilt and shame for a well-analyzed and corrected mistake is the Pig’s way of doing penance in advance for its plan to Binge again.

Chapter 15 – “Unconscious” Bingeing

we consciously decided not to think about what we were doing during a Binge. We turned a blind eye so the Pig could have its Slop. We did NOT go into a temporary coma while the Pig did its thing!

Remember, you can and should let go of the guilt and shame associated with Bingeing once you’ve analyzed the Squeals, corrected your Food Plan (if necessary,) and re-committed 100%…

Chapter 16 –Your New Best Friend





Chapter 17 – Your Personal Pig Squeal Journal

And—especially in the beginning—the Pig will be busy dreaming up NEW ways to disguise its Squeals.

Once the Pig’s Squeals are in black and white it takes less energy to recognize and ignore them.

Chapter 18 – Binge Anxiety

What’s underneath “I’m afraid I might Binge” is just the Pig saying “I really, really want to Binge!”

no eres tu. es el Pig

Any and all doubt in your ability to Never Binge Again is Pig Squeal.
